 * 1. Why do we need programming languages instead of just 0s and 1s?
 *    Computers understand only understand the binary language (0s and 1s). If we wrote programs in pure binary,
 *       it would be very difficult and time-consuming for people to read
 *          and debug.So we use  Programming languages  as a bridge between humans and machines.
 *             It allow developers to write instructions in a way that is easier to understand,
 *                which the compiler translates them into 0s and 1s for the computer to understand.

 *                2. Why do engineers need to learn C specifically?
 *                   C is one of the most powerful and widely used programming languages.
 *                      It allows direct control of hardware and memory, making it very efficient.
 *                         Most modern languages (like Python, Java, C++) are built using C or based on its concepts.
 *                            Engineers learn C because it teaches them how computers really work,
 *                               and it is heavily used in system programming, embedded systems,
 *                                  operating systems, and performance-critical applications.
